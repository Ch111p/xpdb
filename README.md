# Xpdb

### Description

​	A debugger for python bytecode(pyc file). Support to both python2 and python3(different file)

​	For python3's version, you should run it on python3.7+, cuz from that version, Python had add a official support to trace opcode.

​	For python2's version, the way to trace opcode is basically based on [this article](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200804/wicked_hack_python_bytecode_tracing.html). I tested it on python 2.7.

​	It's just a simple project for my course, so no promise for robustness.
